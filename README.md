# Installation Instructions

# Usage

The top-level script **create_krasddpcams.R** is the recommended entry point to the pipeline and by default reproduces the figures and results from the computational analyses described in the following publication: [The energetic and allosteric landscape for KRAS inhibition (Weng C, Faure AJ & Lehner B, 2022)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.06.519122v1). See [Required Data](#required-data) for instructions on how to obtain all required data and miscellaneous files before running the pipeline. Expected run time is less than 1h.
